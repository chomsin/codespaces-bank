# GitHub Codespaces/Jupyter 

Welcome to your shiny new codespace! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Python and Jupyter notebooks.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!
